# PilerDB

This R package contains Party/Identity-Language, Ethnicity and Religion (PILER)
database, along with the code to build the database.

The database contains a calculation of the degree of division in the country,
based on patterns of how different groups support political parties. This
calculation is based on data drawn from a number of publicly available
cross-national surveys.

The code is designed to make it straightforward to extend coverage in the
database by adding new surveys.

More information can be found in the package documentation and associated
papers.
